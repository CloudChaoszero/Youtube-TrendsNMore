Welcome,

Starting off the year, I thought I should develop a project soley based on descriptive statistics and data wrangling performance. You can find the Data Wrangling in the Data Inspection folder, and analysis in the...Analysis Folder.

However, this still is an analysis on both Youtube statistics and other miscellaneous Youtube information. 

The Dataset was provided by Kaggle user Mitchell J, here https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new Thank you Mitchell J.

The objective of this project is to determine

From the list of trending videos that occured from November 2017-January 2018,

What are the top 10 trending

1. Youtube videos

2. Categories

3. Youtube Channels

based on user view counts

Question # 2
From the top videos, categories, and Youtube channels, what countries dominate those spaces?

Question # 3
Lastly, for these topics, what were the most disliked, liked, and ratio of likes?

From this analysis, we can distinguish what types of topics trending during the winter, and some of their characteristics.
